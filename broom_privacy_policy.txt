- **Address Documentation**: Storing photos associated with saved addresses for your convenience

### Data Storage

- Photos are stored securely in Firebase Cloud Storage
- Only authenticated users can access the app and upload photos

## Detailed Camera Permission Explanation

### When We Access Your Camera

The app will request camera access only when you explicitly:
1. Tap the "Add Photo" button when creating/editing a property address
2. Tap the "Add Photo" button when posting a cleaning job
3. Tap the camera icon to change your profile picture
4. Choose "Camera" option in photo source dialogs

### What Happens to Your Photos

1. **Upload Process**:
   - Photo is captured or selected by you
   - Photo is uploaded to secure Firebase Cloud Storage
   - A secure URL is generated and stored in our database
   - Photo becomes accessible based on its context (profile, address, or job)

2. **Access Control**:
   - Profile photos: Visible to users you interact with
   - Address photos: Only visible to you and cleaners viewing your job posts
   - Job photos: Visible to cleaners evaluating that specific job request

3. **Deletion**:
   - You can delete any photo you've uploaded
   - Deleting a job or address also deletes associated photos
   - Photos are permanently removed from storage when deleted

### Revoking Camera Permission

You can revoke camera permission at any time through your device settings:
- **Android**: Settings → Apps → Vix → Permissions → Camera → Deny
- After revoking, you can still use the app but won't be able to take new photos (you can still select from gallery if that permission is granted)
